    <h2>My Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <p>
      When I'm not on the job, I like to unwind and pursue some of my favorite
      pastimes. Here's a glimpse into what I enjoy outside of work:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <h3><li>Exploring the Great Outdoors</li></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I’ve always had a love for the wilderness. Whether it’s camping,
          fishing, or just taking a long ride through uncharted territory,
          there’s nothing like the freedom of the open land.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><li>Hunting and Wildlife Tracking</li></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A skilled marksman never misses an opportunity to test his aim.
          Hunting isn’t just a pastime—it’s a way of life. I respect the land
          and the creatures on it, always ensuring to hunt responsibly.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><li>Horseback Riding</li></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Horses have been my faithful companions for years. I take great pride
          in my horsemanship, and there's nothing like the bond between a rider
          and their steed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><li>Sketching and Journaling</li></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Life on the road offers countless moments worth capturing. I keep a
          journal where I sketch the landscapes I come across and jot down
          thoughts and reflections.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
